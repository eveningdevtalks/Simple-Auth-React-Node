# Simple Auth -React üîë‚öõÔ∏è

We created this project to demonstrate the usage of authentication API with React.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

UI designing is done with [Material UI - React](https://material-ui.com/)

Server calls handling done with [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios)


## How to get start

Create `.env` file using the `.env.example` file and update the `REACT_APP_API_URL` with server url.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
